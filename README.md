# DompdfUI

This is a portable executable file that implements a command line interface for the Dompdf library on Windows and Linux operating systems. There are no external dependencies since static linking is used, and the PHP interpreter and the Dompdf library itself are embedded inside the executable file. All you need to use it is to download and run it in the terminal. Dompdfui is not a full-fledged html to pdf converter, but is only intended for testing the Dompdf library in different environments.
